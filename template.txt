# Artificial and Computational Intelligence Assignment 5
#Use Bi-directional search strategy for the given Assignment.
#Things to follow
    #1.	Use appropriate data structures to represent the graph and the path using python libraries
    #2.	Provide proper documentation
    #3.	Find the path and print it
#Coding begins here



#1.	Define the agent environment in the following block
    #PEAS environment, Initial data structures to define the graph and variable declarations


#2.	Define a formula that Checks for existence of path
    #Function for checking for the  path


#3.	Implementation of bi-directional search technique for finding the path
    #Code block 1


#4.	Calling main function
    #Function call to the bi-directional search technique


#5.	The agent should provide the following output
    #5.1.	Whether a path exists
    #Function to find the existence of path


    #5.2.	The path that covers required vertices in the graph
    #Function that prints the path covering required vertices using bi-directional search


    #5.3.	Print the total number of vertices (areas) visited by the agent in finding the path
    #Execute code to print the number of vertices travelled to cover the path. (using bi-directional search)
